Retainer-ship Programme

Retainership 
A "retainer" refers to an individual or firm retained by a company or organization to provide expert advice on complex matters such as 
labor laws, provident fund issues, arbitration, civil and criminal cases, or intellectual property matters etc. Unlike regular employees, 
retainers are not required to maintain daily attendance or adhere to fixed working hours. Instead, they charge a retainer fee for their 
services. If their attendance or representation is needed before government authorities or in court, they charge separate fees for such 
services. The specific terms of engagement as a 'Retainer' can vary.
A retainership contract involves hiring employees on a retainer basis. Since there are no fixed office hours in such contracts, statutory 
employment requirements like provident fund contributions, Employee State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) benefits, bonuses, gratuity, 
etc., do not apply to individuals or their firms. The working hours, monthly charges, and other benefits (if required) are determined 
through mutual understanding and the terms of the contract. Importantly, there is no master-servant relationship in such contracts.
In the world of retainerships, time is a valuable resource, and this notion holds when it comes to compensation for services rendered. In 
the case of Ross, Barrett & Scott v. Simanic 1997 Carswell NS 347, Justice Moir emphasized the importance of lawyers establishing 
their retainers clearly in writing. This duty has given rise to a rule: in cases where there is no written retainer agreement, and a dispute 
arises between the lawyer and the client regarding the terms of the retainer, the client's version of the terms takes precedence over the 
lawyer’s.
In India, the concept of retainership and fee disputes has been addressed through various legal precedents. One notable case is:
Rohit Narayan v. Union of India (2007) 3 SCC 55:
In this case, the Supreme Court of India emphasized the importance of clear and written retainership agreements between clients and 
lawyers. The court held that a written agreement helps establish the terms of the engagement, including fees, and reduces the likelihood 
of disputes. The judgment stressed that lawyers have a duty to ensure clarity in retainerships, and in cases where there is a conflict 
between the lawyer's version and the client's version of the agreement, the court is inclined to consider the client's perspective, 
especially in the absence of a written contract.
The "Rohit Narayan" case is an illustration of the Indian legal system's approach to retaining legal services and the significance of clear, 
written agreements in such relationships.
In summary, retainerships in India are governed by legal principles that prioritize clear and written agreements to avoid disputes. The 
"Rohit Narayan" case serves as a reminder of the importance of clarity and transparency in such engagements, ensuring that clients and 
lawyers are on the same page regarding the terms of the retainer. 
This guiding principle is often referred to as the "rule of practice." Having a clear, written explanation of the retainer terms can help 
prevent fee disputes from arising or, if they do occur, assist the lawyer in substantiating the agreed-upon fee structure.

Benefits 
benefits of keeping a law firm on retainer
8
To keep a law firm or solicitor on hand to cater to all your legal needs, you can establish a written 
retainer agreement between yourself or your business and a law firm. A retainer fee is then paid to 
secure the law firm’s availability, typically in the form of a monthly fee calculated according to 
your legal needs and the law firm’s usual hourly fee. 
 1. Assured Legal Support :By securing the services of a solicitor on retainer, you gain the 
invaluable assurance of having steadfast access to reliable legal counsel and representation at 
your disposal. This assurance is particularly paramount for business proprietors who 
continually grapple with multifarious legal requirements across diverse domains, encompassing 
employment regulations, immigration statutes, data protection protocols, and tax obligations. 
With a law firm on retainer, the anxiety of incurring costs with each legal interaction dissipates, 
affording you the freedom to seek legal guidance without financial apprehension. 
2. Custom-Tailored Expertise: Opting for a law firm on retainer transcends the sporadic 
selection of legal counsel as needed. It endows the firm with a holistic comprehension of your 
business's intricate challenges, thereby enabling the judicious assignment of solicitors within the 
firm who are ideally suited to address your ever-evolving legal requisites. 
3. Financial Prudence: When legal counsel is recurrently required, whether for expert 
advisement or legal representation, the remittance of a retainer fee emerges as a judicious fiscal 
alternative when contrasted with the establishment of an in-house legal team tasked with 
addressing your company's legal exigencies. The perpetual availability of apt legal counsel, 
regardless of the scale or intricacy of the matter at hand, serves as a preventive measure against 
protracted, costly legal disputes, as well as potential civil or criminal liabilities over time.
9
4. Professional Indemnity Assurance: Entrusting your legal requirements to a regulated law 
firm ensures that the counsel proffered is fortified by professional indemnity insurance. This added 
layer of safeguarding offers unequivocal peace of mind, a safeguard that is typically unattainable 
when maintaining an internal legal department. 
5. The Foundation of Long-Term Success: A law firm on retainer is not just a legal service 
provider; it's a strategic partner dedicated to the long-term prosperity of your enterprise. Over time, 
this partnership matures into a robust legal framework that safeguards your business interests and 
streamlines operations. It guarantees ongoing compliance with the ever-evolving legislative 
landscape and empowers your solicitors to craft innovative legal solutions for every challenge your 
enterprise encounters. 
6. Swift, Strategic Response: In the unpredictable realm of legal matters, timing is often of the 
essence. With a law firm on retainer, you're not left scrambling to find legal counsel when urgent 
issues arise. The ability to summon immediate, strategic responses to legal challenges can be the 
difference between a minor setback and a major crisis. 
7. Holistic Legal Coverage: Retainer agreements often encompass the comprehensive array of 
legal services, ranging from contract reviews and employment issues to litigation representation and 
regulatory compliance. It ensures that your legal needs are met comprehensively under a single 
umbrella, eliminating the need to engage multiple law firms for various matters. 
In conclusion, retaining a law firm's services is not a mere convenience; it's an investment in your 
confidence, your business's resilience, and its long-term success. It equips you to navigate the 
labyrinthine complexities of the legal landscape with poise and precision, ensuring that you not only 
emerge unscathed but stronger and better prepared for the challenges that lie ahead.

Our Unique Approach: Elevating Your Business
In the legal profession, firms often claim to be unique, touting their distinctiveness with phrases like "we pride

with our valued clients.
1. Clear and Accessible Communication:
In the world of law, clarity is paramount. While we are legal professionals, we understand the importance of 
communicating in a business-oriented language rather than inundating our clients with legal jargon. Our goal 
is to ensure that you fully comprehend your options in terms that align with your business objectives.
2. A People-Centric Perspective:
Behind every legal matter lies the human element, whether it's contracts, employment disputes, or complex 
transactions. We recognize the profound human dynamics at play and approach legal issues with both

business world and the importance of timely communication. We are committed to being 
approachable, accessible, and highly responsive. We aim to respond promptly, often within the same 
day, and keep you informed. We also adapt to your preferred communication method, whether it's 
text, email, or a quick phone call.
6. Transparent Pricing:
Transparency in legal fees is essential for building trust. We believe you should have a clear 
understanding of the cost of legal services concerning the benefits they provide. We aim to offer fixed 
fees whenever possible. This means you have a predetermined cost for our legal services, free from 
hidden fees or surprises. We want you to have confidence in the financial aspect of our services, 
allowing for effective budgeting without unexpected expenses.
In cases where fixed fees may not be feasible, such as complex litigation with uncertain scope, we 
break down the costs into clear stages. At each juncture, you have the opportunity to assess progress 
and decide whether to continue. This approach gives you control over costs and allows you to make 
informed decisions based on the evolving situation.
7. Building Long-Term Relationships:
Our commitment extends beyond transactional engagements. We place significant value on long-term 
relationships with our clients, recognizing the importance of trust and a deep understanding of your 
business. Instead of focusing solely on individual transactions, we aim to nurture enduring 
partnerships. Our objective is to provide unwavering support through the legal and compliance 
challenges that businesses inevitably face, creating a robust legal framework that safeguards your 
interests.
13
A Deeper Dive into Our Approach
To gain a more profound understanding of our approach to legal services, let's delve further into each of these principles.
1. Clear and Accessible Communication:
In the legal field, the use of complex language and jargon is unfortunately common. This can create an intimidating barrier for 
clients who simply seek clarity and understanding. At our firm, we recognize this challenge and have made it our mission to bridge 
the gap between legal intricacies and business comprehension.
Our commitment to clear and accessible communication starts with a dedication to speaking the language of business. We believe 
that legal advice should be conveyed in terms that resonate with our client's business objectives. This means avoiding unnecessary 
jargon or overly technical language. We want our clients to fully grasp the implications of their legal options without the need for a 
legal dictionary.
This principle extends to our documentation and written communications as well. Whether it's contracts, agreements, or legal 
opinions, we take care to ensure that these documents are not just legally sound but also easily understandable. We want our clients 
to feel confident in the documents they are presented with, knowing that they reflect their intentions and business goals accurately.
Moreover, our commitment to accessibility means that we are readily available to discuss any questions or concerns that may arise. 
We encourage open and candid dialogue with our clients, fostering an environment where they feel comfortable seeking 
clarification on any legal matter. This accessibility extends to our choice of communication channels, whether it's email, phone 
calls, or face-to-face meetings. Our goal is to make the legal process as approachable and transparent as possible.
2. A People-Centric Perspective:
Legal matters are not abstract concepts; they involve real people with real interests, needs, and emotions. Whether it's negotiating a 
contract, resolving an employment dispute, or navigating a merger, the individuals involved are at the heart of the matter. 
Recognizing this human dimension is central to our approach.
Empathy, understanding, and an acute awareness of human dynamics are embedded in our practice. We believe that a legal solution 
is only truly effective when it considers the impact on all parties involved. This perspective is particularly crucial in dispute 
resolution, where emotions can run high, and relationships can be strained.
In negotiation, we approach discussions with a focus on win-win outcomes whenever possible. This means seeking solutions that 
not only serve our client's interests but also respect the interests and needs of the other party. While we advocate vigorously for our 
clients, we do so with a commitment to fairness and professionalism.
Moreover, in cases involving employees or workplace disputes, we recognize the significance of preserving workplace harmony 
and employee morale. Our approach is designed to minimize disruption while achieving fair and just outcomes.
14
3. Listening First:
Every client and every legal matter is unique. Understanding the specific nuances of each situation is paramount to 
providing effective legal counsel. That's why we begin our client relationships with attentive listening.
Your first conversation with us is an opportunity for you to share your concerns, goals, and challenges. We consider 
this initial discussion as a crucial foundation for our collaboration. It is a time for us to gather information, ask 
questions, and gain a comprehensive understanding of your business and its unique context.
This initial consultation is offered without charge because we believe that understanding your big picture is 
essential. We want to grasp the full scope of your enterprise and the outcomes you aspire to achieve. This 
commitment to listening first allows us to tailor our legal advice and solutions to your specific needs and objectives.
4. Goal-Oriented Precision:
Legal solutions should not be one-size-fits-all. While many businesses encounter similar legal challenges, the 
optimal approach can vary significantly from one situation to another. Our approach is rooted in goal-oriented 
precision.
We begin by acknowledging that your business is unique. Even if the legal issues you face seem similar to those of 
other businesses, the context, objectives, and constraints are distinct. Our role is that of a problem solver, and we are 
dedicated to helping you make informed decisions that align with your specific business landscape.
When presenting options and strategies, we do so with a clear understanding of your desired outcomes. We consider 
the potential benefits and risks of each approach, providing you with a comprehensive view of the path ahead. This 
empowers you to make decisions that are not only legally sound but also strategically advantageous.
Our commitment to goal-oriented precision extends to our legal documentation. Whether it's drafting contracts, 
agreements, or legal opinions, we tailor these documents to reflect your specific intentions and objectives. We take 
pride in our meticulous attention to detail, ensuring that every word serves a purpose in advancing your goals.
15
5. Approachability and Responsiveness:
One of the most common complaints about legal professionals is their perceived inaccessibility and unresponsiveness. We understand that the 
business world operates at a fast pace, and timely communication is essential. Our commitment is to be highly approachable and responsive.
We recognize that questions, concerns, and legal matters can arise at any time. We make it a priority to be readily available to address your 
needs. This includes responding promptly to emails and returning phone calls promptly. We understand that waiting for answers or assistance 
can be both frustrating and detrimental to business operations. Therefore, we strive to provide efficient and effective communication.
Moreover, we appreciate that different clients have different preferences when it comes to communication methods. Some may prefer the 
convenience of email, while others may prefer a quick phone call or a face-to-face meeting. We adapt to your preferred mode of 
communication to ensure that our interactions are as convenient and effective as possible.
6. Transparent Pricing:
Transparency in pricing is a fundamental element of trust in the legal profession. We firmly believe that you should have a clear understanding 
of the cost of legal services and how it aligns with the benefits it provides to your business. Our approach to pricing is characterized by 
transparency and fairness.
We aim to provide fixed fees whenever possible. This means that you will have a clear and predetermined cost for our legal services. There are 
no hidden fees or surprises. We want you to have confidence in the financial aspect of our services, knowing that you can budget effectively 
without unexpected expenses.
In cases where fixed fees may not be feasible, such as complex litigation where the scope of work is uncertain, we take a different approach. 
We break down the costs into logical stages. At each stage, you have the opportunity to assess the progress and determine whether to continue. 
This approach gives you control over the costs and allows you to make informed decisions based on the evolving situation.
Our overarching goal in pricing is to provide you with cost-effective solutions that align with your business objectives. We want you to view 
our legal services as an investment that delivers tangible value to your enterprise.
7. Building Long-Term Relationships:
While transactional engagements may serve certain purposes, we place significant value on long-term relationships with our clients. We 
recognize that trust and a deep understanding of your business can only be developed over time. Our commitment extends beyond immediate 
legal needs to the establishment of enduring partnerships.
We take a long-term view of how we can support your business right from the start. While one-off transactions may be financially appealing for 
a law firm, we prioritize the cultivation of lasting relationships. Our objective is to provide consistent and unwavering support through the legal 
and compliance challenges that businesses inevitably face.
This commitment to long-term relationships is particularly important in the realm of business law, where the legal landscape can change, and 
new challenges can emerge. We aim to be your trusted legal advisors, helping you navigate these challenges and adapt to evolving legal 
requirements.
