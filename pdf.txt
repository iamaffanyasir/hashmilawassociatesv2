Bankruptcy & Insolvency Lawyer in Delhi
Insolvency and Bankruptcy, a unified code came into force in 2016. The Insolvency and bankruptcy law is a form of social legislation encompassing all 
companies, partnerships, and individuals. It aims to proving relief to all of them. It undertakes to maximize the value of the assets of the debtors and 
also tries to balance the interest of all the shareholders. The Code guarantees to achieve far-reaching reforms with a push on creditor-driven insolvency 
resolution. It aims at prior identification of financial failure and increasing the asset value of insolvent firms/companies.
Insolvency refers to a state in which a person does not have sufficient property for repaying his debts. An ‘insolvent’ person ceases to pay his debts in 
the ordinary course of business.
Bankruptcy is said to be the last resort when financial issues are spilled out of control. It is a statutory procedure caused by insolvency through which a 
person is relieved of most of its debts and undergoes judiciary supervision or liquidator for the benefit of that person’s creditor.
The Central Government has constituted National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) under section 408 of the Companies Act, 2013 (18 of 2013) w.e.f. 
0106.2016. In the first phase the Ministry of Corporate Affairs has set up eleven Benches, one Principal Bench in New Delhi and one each Regional
